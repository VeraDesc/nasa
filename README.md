#WALK THE WORLD
Take a break. Take a virtual walk on mother earth. 
 
# Summary
What astronauts might really miss in space is being in nature. With our app they can choose a place on earth and take a virtual walk there. This virtual walk might not only be a distraction from the daily space routines but it also might have profound positive effects on their well being. 

# Life in space
A spaceship is a very mechanical environment. The astronauts are surrounded by computers, machines and equipment. There are no plants, no animals, no fresh air and little sounds. Earth is far away and what might be really missed during a mars mission is nature with its familiar sights, lights and sounds. 

# Nature makes us feel good
Nature has positive effects on our well being (1): 
Exposure to natural environment 
- reduces stress, 
- improves mood and 
- mproves cognitive performance. 
Studies have shown that both being in nature and viewing pictures of natural environments enhance well-being.(2)

# Take a break with virtual walks
Taking a virtual walk through nature offers a time out from life in space. Immersing in nature astronauts can relax, virtually explore new places on earth, go jogging or just listen to the soothing sounds of nature. 

# The videos
The videos show a walk through in nature (or maybe in a city). They should be as authentic as possible. That means that they should come with the original sounds and not be cut. The videos should be in high quality and have a length of 10 â€“ 25 minutes.

#How it works
Our app shows a worldmap with pins on it. Each pin is linked to a video showing a walk through the place where the pin is located. 
The pins on the worldmap can be set by users: 

- On earth -
1. A user takes a video of a walk through of a place (with sound).
2. The user uploads the video to youtube or any other platform. 
3. With our app the user sets a link to the video and geotaggs it (GPS Data of the video).
4. The video is now pinned on our virtual worlmap at the coordinates of the video.

- In Space -
5. The astronaut clicks on a pin on the worldmap. The link to the video opens.
6. A random search show

#The outcome
With our app it might soon be possible to take virtual walks through many places on earth. 
This virtual walk expierence might be interesting not only for people in space but also for earthlings that are interested in taking virtual walks in places they have never been before.

Space Recreation

Take a break. Take a virtual walk on mother earth
- Virtual walks through places on earth -

# Summary
What astronauts might really miss in space is being in nature. With our app they can choose a place on earth and take a virtual walk there. This virtual walk might not only be a distraction from the daily space routines but it also might have profound positive effects on their well being.

# Life in space
A spaceship is a very mechanical environment. The astronauts are surrounded by computers, machines and equipment. There are no plants, no animals, no fresh air and little sounds. Earth is far away and what might be really missed during a mars mission is nature with its familiar sights, lights and sounds. 

# Nature makes us feel good
Nature has positive effects on our well being (1): 
Exposure to natural environment 
- reduces stress, 
- improves mood and 
- mproves cognitive performance. 
Studies have shown that both being in nature and viewing pictures of natural environments enhance well-being.(2)

# Take a break with virtual walks
Taking a virtual walk through nature offers a time out from life in space. Immersing in nature astronauts can relax, virtually explore new places on earth, go jogging or just listen to the soothing sounds of nature. 

# The videos
The videos show a walk through in nature (or maybe in a city). They should be as authentic as possible. That means that they should come with the original sounds and not be cut. The videos should be in high quality and have a length of 10 â€“ 25 minutes.
